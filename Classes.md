# Classes: Pros, Cons, and Difficulty

### Hunter

Pros:
- Top-Tier Leveling
- Very High Mobility
- Good Multi-Target Damage
- Low Gear Dependance
- High Sustain
- High Self Reliance

Cons:
- Ammo + Food Dependance
- Reduced Inventory Space
- Keeping Pet Abilities up to Date (Taming)

The Hunter is arguably the strongest choice for reaching 60 without dying. Their toolkit provides them with tools that outmatch nearly all other classes in leveling which has given them a reputation for being the kings of leveling.

### Warlock

Pros:
- Tier 1 Leveling Speed
- High Damage
- High Sustain
- High Utility
- Self-Reliant
- *Stronk* Multi-Target Damage
- Low Gear Dependance
- Strong Open World PvP
- Free level 40 Mount

Cons:
- Horribly Low Mobility Until 40
- Reduced Inventory Space (Soul Shards)
- Pet Training Cost (Grimoires)

Another solid pick as a ranged pet class with efficient damage and self-sustain, the Warlock will give you a fighting chance at the challenge. As long as you don't get overconfident and overextend yourself that is.

### Rogue

Pros:
- Stealth
- Many Escape Tools
- High Single Target DPS
- Lots of Crowd Control

Cons:
- Bottom-Tier Leveling Speed
- Low Mobility
- No Self-Heal
- Low Sustain
- Gear Dependant
- Low Multi-Target Proficiency

Now the Rogue may seem like an iffy choice based on those lists, and it is a more challenging class. However, it is stronger than it appears. If you are aware of your surroundings and utilize your full kit, you will be able to have tight control over combat and escape from nearly any bad situation you will find yourself in. It is absolutely much slower than other classes, especially 1-20, but it is still a viable choice as all classes are. It really depends on your taste in gameplay.

### Mage

Pros:
- Mid-Tier Leveling Speed (Potentially Top-Tier)
- High Damage
- *Stronk* AoE Grinding - Most Efficient
- Gear Independent
- Free Consumables (Food / Water / Mana Pots)
- Above Average Movement Speed (Blink / Teleports)
- Fantastic Utility
- Hard + Soft Crowd Control Options
- Smooth Weapon Progression (Wands, Staves)

Cons:
- Slow Leveling 1-20
- Low Sustain = Lots of Drinking
- No Self Healing
- Squishy
- Difficulty Soloing Targets Immune to Freeze
- Not much Talent Flexibility
- AoE Grinding Susceptible to Griefing

The Mage is one of the best leveling classes due to its high damage, great control, and self-reliance. It may not be able to heal, but it has incredible escape/control tools to get out of bad situations (or prevent them to begin with), and can make their own food and water cutting down on costs significantly.

### Druid

Pros:
- Top-Tier Leveling Speed
- Highest Movement Speed in the Game
- Best Questers Because ^
- Low Gear Dependance
- High Sustain
- Strong Self Healing
- Decent Crowd Control
- Can Tank, DPS, or Heal
- Can Stealth

Cons:
- Slow Start from Lvls 1-20
- Mediocre ST Kill Speed 1-20, 40+
- Subpar Grinding Efficiency

Druids are the most versatile class in the game and are able to be a tank, healer, caster dps, and melee dps. They have many good talents that can produce very different builds, all of which have amazing mobility 20+ or 30+ with strong escape tools in roots, stuns, and shapeshifting. They are slow to start, but rapidly pick up after 20 if you build into the feral talent tree.

### Warrior
Pros:

- Recognized as the Most Difficult Class, so Bonus Points for You
- Flexible Weapon Progression
- Can use all Weapons minus wands

Cons:
- Slow Leveling
- Low Mobility
- Low Sustain
- High Gear Dependance
- Dependance on Consumables
- Costly Repairs
- High Damage Intake
- Difficulty Farming Gold

The Warrior is pretty universally recognized as the most difficult class to level solo. You do high damage if you have good gear, and you have interesting abilities that allow very aggresive play or very defensive play. If you don't have gear though, you will be struggling through many encounters and must pick your fights cautiously. Don't pick this if you want your best shot at getting to 60. If you're up for the challenege though, it is incredibly fun and rewarding.

### Priest

Pros:
- Mid-Tier Leveling Speed
- Mana Efficient Solo Grinding
- 0 Downtime
- Flexible Talents Pre-40/45
- Big Heals
- Mind Control

Cons:
- Mediocre ST Kill Speed
- Low Mobility
- Limited Crowd Control
- Wand Dependance
- Limited Escape Tools

Priests are a fairly middle of the road pick. If you don't do anything risky, you shouldn't die. You can heal yourself incredibly easily and are highly mana-efficient. The problem is that they feel slow, and you may want to try to push yourself faster than you can go. Also, if you get into a tricky situation it is not the end of the world, but you will struggle to get out of it more than other classes (excluding maybe only the Warrior).

### Paladin - Alliance Only

Pros:
- Can Solo Elites & Group Content
- High Utility and Many Defensives
- High Sustain
- Self Reliant
- Capable of AoE Grinding
- Free Mount at lvl 40

Cons:
- Bottom-tier Leveling Speed
- Low Mobility
- No On Demand Slow
- Limited CC Potential
- Gear Dependant
- Canâ€™t use Staves

Paladins are a strong option to survive to 60 with. Their leveling speed is decent at best and garbage at worst. As long as you don't get stuck in caves, manage your resources, and know when to run, you will have a good shot at 60. tldr; Paladins are safe, but dead slow.

### Shaman - Horde Only

Pros:
- Mid-Tier Leveling Speed
- High Burst Damage
- Amazing Utility
- Talent Flexibility
- High Mobility
- Ancestral Recall (2nd Hearthstone)
- Strong Self Healing
- Excellent at Kiting
- Most Interrupting Class
- Can Tank, DPS, or Heal
- Can Solo Elites

Cons:
- Constant Mana Management
- Lots of Keybinds (**LOTS** of Abilities)
- Struggle vs. Multiple Targets
- Moderate Gear Dependance
- No Taunt
- No Hard Crowd Control

Shamans are a decent pick as far as their strength, but they are a fantastic pick for fun. The range of abilities a shaman has across their toolkit, and especially in their totems, is unlike any other class's. They are not the fastest and can be difficult to sustain in early levels, but once they get access to more tools, they become a pretty strong class to survive the grind.
