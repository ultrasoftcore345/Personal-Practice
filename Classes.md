# Classes: Pros, Cons, and Difficulty

### Hunter

Pros:
- Top-Tier Leveling
- Very High Mobility
- Good Multi-Target Damage
- Low Gear Dependance
- High Sustain
- High Self Reliance

Cons:
- Ammo + Food Dependance
- Reduced Inventory Space
- Keeping Pet Abilities up to Date (Taming)

The Hunter is arguably the strongest choice for reaching 60 without dying. Their toolkit provides them with tools that outmatch nearly all other classes in leveling which has given them a reputation for being the kings of leveling.

### Warlock

Pros:
- Tier 1 Leveling Speed
- High Damage
- High Sustain
- High Utility
- Self-Reliant
- *Stronk* Multi-Target Damage
- Low Gear Dependance
- Strong Open World PvP
- Free level 40 Mount

Cons:
- Horribly Low Mobility Until 40
- Reduced Inventory Space (Soul Shards)
- Pet Training Cost (Grimoires)

Another solid pick as a ranged pet class with efficient damage and self-sustain, the Warlock will give you a fighting chance at the challenge. As long as you don't get overconfident and overextend yourself that is.

### Rogue

Pros:
- Stealth
- Many Escape Tools
- High Single Target DPS
- Lots of Crowd Control

Cons:
- Bottom-Tier Leveling Speed
- Low Mobility
- No Self-Heal
- Low Sustain
- Gear Dependant
- Low Multi-Target Proficiency

Now the Rogue may seem like an iffy choice based on those lists, and it is a more challenging class. However, it is stronger than it appears. If you are aware of your surroundings and utilize your full kit, you will be able to have tight control over combat and escape from nearly any bad situation you will find yourself in. It is absolutely much slower than other classes, especially 1-20, but it is still a viable choice as all classes are. It really depends on your taste in gameplay.

### Mage

Pros:
- Mid-Tier Leveling Speed (Potentially Top-Tier)
- High Damage
- *Stronk* AoE Grinding - Most Efficient
- Gear Independent
- Free Consumables (Food / Water / Mana Pots)
- Above Average Movement Speed (Blink / Teleports)
- Fantastic Utility
- Hard + Soft Crowd Control Options
- Smooth Weapon Progression (Wands, Staves)

Cons:
- Slow Leveling 1-20
- Low Sustain = Lots of Drinking
- No Self Healing
- Squishy
- Difficulty Soloing Targets Immune to Freeze
- Not much Talent Flexibility
- AoE Grinding Susceptible to Griefing

The Mage is one of the best leveling classes due to its high damage, great control, and self-reliance. It may not be able to heal, but it has incredible escape/control tools to get out of bad situations (or prevent them to begin with), and can make their own food and water cutting down on costs significantly.
